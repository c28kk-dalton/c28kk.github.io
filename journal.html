	<div class="entries" id="entry1">Entry 1: I am currently designing my website. The design process has been very fun, and I have learned a lot! One thing that I had trouble with was uploading fonts. One thing that I was good at was creating the boxes and the links to each of my pages! <br> <br>Entry 2: We are publishing our websites today! Unfortunately, mine is not appearing when I look it up in a browser. Hopefully I can fix it soon!<br><br> Entry 3: Today, we are working on adding more details to our websites. Unfortunately, my website still has not published and we cannot figure out what the problem is. I will be working on my projects page today. <br><br> Entry 4: Today I am putting my first two projects onto my projects page! We learned how to use event listeners, and I made a project where you can pick the color of a flower! I also made a project that when a key is pressed, the dog and cat move to the other side of the screen. <br><br> Entry 5: Today, we worked on using event listeners to add sound when the screen is clicked. I made a girl waving and saying hello! It has been really cool to learn how to use different actions such as "click" and "alert". </div>
